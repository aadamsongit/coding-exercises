    <section class="about-container"><h3 class="about-header">About</h3>
    <p class="about-info">I am a fullstack developer (cumulative 3+ years experience) trained in Python, JavaScript libraries/frameworks, and Java. I have worked primarily with React and Python, including a year working in IT Automation for Takeda Pharmaceutical, a Fortune 500 company. My current focus is on mastering React and possibly other JavaScript frameworks (Angular/Vue), as well as associated technology, such as NextJS, TypeScript, GraphQL, containerization, and test-driven development. Follow my LinkedIn and my blog, <a href="https://techtrackerchronicles.com/">Tech Tracker Chronicles</a>, to be a part of my journey to grow my abilities and secure a fullstack developer role.</p>
    <h3 class="interests-header">Interests</h3>
    <p class="interests-info">Apart from my interest in programming, I enjoy reading a wide variety of books/literature. I'm also into fitness, fashion, and gaming, which includes playing video and mobile games, and designing my own text-based roleplay game (which I also did with quite a bit of image work/CSS). I'm interested in TTRPG as well, though I haven't participated in this yet. I enjoy YouTube series and podcasts, particularly on subjects such as history, which is also a big interest of mine. I'm also looking to take up other hobbies, such as art, crochet, and maybe cooking/baking. When I have the money to do so again, I'm looking to do a lot of travel. I believe in aspiring towards a well-rounded life.</p></section>
